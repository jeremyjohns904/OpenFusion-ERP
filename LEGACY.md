## The Legacy of OpenFusion  
This project began as a whisper—equal parts dream, defiance, and devotion.  
OpenFusion is my attempt to reconcile the sacred and the systematic,  
to craft an ERP platform as elegant as code and as truthful as the plumb line.  
It is born from pain, recovery, a desire to leave something real behind.

I am Jeremy Johns. I am a father, a husband, a unicorn, and a survivor.  
As of this writing, I am in remission from Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).  
The road has not been easy—but it has been clarifying.  
This project is my response to that clarity.

If I am not here to finish it, I ask that you consider this legacy  
not as a burden, but as a gift.  
OpenFusion is more than an open-source platform.  
It is a **philosophy of transparency**,  
of **integration between disciplines**,  
of **truth through right relationship**—with data, with teams, with ourselves.

It is not just an ERP system.  
It is a **cathedral of code**—meant to be built collaboratively, in the light.

## What I Hope OpenFusion Will Become:
- A **fully open-source ERP system** that serves real businesses,  
  with no hidden agendas, paywalls, or traps.
- A **bridge** between accountants, analysts, developers, and dreamers.
- A **living artifact** of what it means to build responsibly—  
  with both logic and love.
- A **witness** to the possibility of meaning in technology.

## If You Pick This Up After Me:
Please keep it true.  
Keep it open.  
Keep it strange and sacred and good.

Let it be **The Real Thing**.

For my children.  
For those who follow.  
*Mo chridhe, always.*
