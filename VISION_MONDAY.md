The Dream

Welcome to OpenFusion: a humble attempt to blend accounting sanity with enterprise resource planning… chaos.

This project was built not because the world needed another ERP system, but because it deserved one that feels like it was handcrafted by someone stuck between a spreadsheet and a quarter-life crisis.

We believe that business systems should be:
	•	Readable (to humans, not just machines)
	•	Extendable (for people with actual opinions)
	•	Auditable (because the IRS has no chill)
	•	Unapologetically opinionated (because being bland is for tax forms)

The Mission (if you choose to accept it)
	•	Bring business logic into a form that doesn’t make people cry at their desks
	•	Let accounting workflows vibe without sacrificing compliance
	•	Enable developers, analysts, and tired consultants to collaborate without needing a séance
	•	Respect the user’s time… or at least waste it stylishly

Who This Is For
	•	People who almost understand ERP systems
	•	Developers who like a side of mystery with their documentation
	•	Accountants with unresolved creative energy
	•	Future contributors who read this file and went, “Wait… what?”

Final Thoughts

This isn’t just a repo. It’s a story. A slightly unhinged, markdown-laced tale of ambition, abstraction, and probably at least one broken deployment script.

If you’ve made it this far: congratulations. You are now part of the vision. Whether you wanted to be or not.
