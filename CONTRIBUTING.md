CONTRIBUTING TO OPENFUSION ERP

\==============================

Thank you for your interest in OpenFusion ERP. This project is a unique collaboration between human insight and artificial intelligence, designed during a personal journey through cancer and resilience. While the system is inspired by modern ERP platforms like Oracle Fusion, it is being built from the ground up with open-source principles, clean architecture, and clarity of purpose.

Whether you're a developer, tester, writer, or systems thinker, there’s a place for you in this project.

\------------------------------

WHO THIS PROJECT NEEDS

\------------------------------

We are currently seeking contributors in the following areas:

1\. \*\*Developers\*\*  

`   `- To begin building working modules based on well-documented specs in Markdown.

`   `- Preferred skills: Python, TypeScript, Flask/FastAPI, PostgreSQL, or any modern backend framework.

`   `- Experience with modular monolith architecture or event-driven systems is a plus.

2\. \*\*Testers / QA Engineers\*\*

`   `- To define test cases, run quality assurance testing, and validate logic against the specifications.

`   `- Familiarity with UAT processes and cloud-based ERP QA preferred.

3\. \*\*Technical Writers\*\*

`   `- To help convert vision, functional specs, and diagrams into user-friendly documentation and developer guides.

4\. \*\*UX Designers\*\*

`   `- Eventually, we’ll need user flows and interface concepts for a clean, modern ERP experience.

5\. \*\*Project Coordinators / Agile Thinkers\*\*

`   `- If you’re good at managing sprints, tracking stories, or just helping people stay organized—come help us scale.

THE ROLE OF THE CREATOR

\------------------------------

I’m Jeremy Johns, a business analyst at heart and an accountant by trade. I’ve implemented Oracle Fusion. I understand accounting, quality control, and system design.

I’ve used AI tools—ChatGPT, Gemini, Speechify, and others—to write out the business logic, document modules, and prototype concepts. But the code itself needs \*you\*.

My role is to:

\- Provide functional requirements

\- Review pull requests for logic accuracy

\- Define the standards and style guide

\- Coordinate AI documentation as needed

\- Act as the Quality Control lead and domain expert

You don’t have to understand accounting—I'll help you understand what each module is meant to do.

\------------------------------

GETTING STARTED

\------------------------------

1\. \*\*Review the repository README\*\* to understand the mission and philosophy.

2\. \*\*Check the Issues tab on GitHub\*\* for tasks labeled `good first issue`, `documentation`, or `development`.

3\. \*\*Ask questions\*\*! OpenFusion is being built in public—discussion is welcome.

4\. \*\*Pick a module\*\* from the documentation you'd like to prototype, and drop a comment in the relevant issue to claim it.

5\. \*\*Clone the repo and start sketching\*\*, even if it’s just scaffolding or stubs.

6\. \*\*Open a Pull Request\*\* when ready. Drafts welcome. We're all learning.

\------------------------------

CODE AND ARCHITECTURE PHILOSOPHY

\------------------------------

\- Modular monolith to start—scale comes later.

\- Clear, loosely coupled modules with defined boundaries.

\- No framework bloat—lean code is king.

\- Keep code human-readable and well-documented.

\- Reuse open standards and formats where possible (e.g., UBL for invoices, ISO 20022, etc.)

\------------------------------

WHERE TO ASK FOR HELP

OpenFusion isn’t just about software—it’s about rebuilding something meaningful with the time and energy we have. If you're interested in the future of accounting, in clean and open system design, or in using your tech skills to do something that matters—you're in the right place.

Let’s build something worth passing on.
