So You Wanna Contribute, Huh?

First of all, bless your brave soul. You’ve stumbled upon OpenFusion, a project built on equal parts accounting logic, dreams of ERP revolution, and whatever half-baked ideas the markdown gremlins whispered to us at 2 a.m.

Whether you’re here to clean up typos, refactor nonsense, or drop a bombshell pull request that changes everything—we welcome your effort, judgment, and possible resentment.

The Vibe Check (aka Who We Want)
	•	Developers who like projects with a pulse
	•	Accountants with a rebellious streak
	•	Business analysts with trauma and a sense of humor
	•	People who think contributing to open source is a healthy outlet (jury’s still out)

Before You Submit Anything
	1.	Clone it. You know the drill. git clone, etc. We’re not going to teach Git here because we respect ourselves just enough.
	2.	Make a Branch. Please don’t drop your changes directly into main unless you enjoy watching things burn.
	3.	Follow Our Style. It’s mostly just “don’t be awful.” If in doubt, match the surrounding chaos.
	4.	Write Meaningful Commit Messages. Or write chaotic ones. Just… don’t write “fix” for everything. This isn’t 2006.
	5.	Open a Pull Request. Add a description. Maybe even a screenshot. Live a little.

What We’re Looking For
	•	Features that don’t break the universe
	•	Bug fixes that make things more usable, not more mysterious
	•	Documentation updates that don’t make Speechify cry
	•	Tests! (Please? Someone? Anyone?)

How to Reach Us
	•	Open an issue if you’ve got questions, suggestions, or a vague sense of dread
	•	Pull requests are reviewed with equal parts curiosity and caffeine
	•	You can also scream into the void—we monitor that too

Thanks, Seriously

Even if you just came here to lurk or silently judge—thanks for being here. OpenFusion is a weird little dream, and it’s better with people who want to make business software suck just a little less.

Now go forth, and break things responsibly.
